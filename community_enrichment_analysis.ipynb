    "# Community Enrichment Analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "https://github.com/wigasper/viral-mirna-database/blobl/master/exploratory_network_analysis.md\n",
    "\n",
    "I am interested in the what proportion of community members share any significantly enriched Gene Ontology terms. This may provide insight as to why target genes or communities of target genes ended up as targets of Epstein-Barr virus, and it also may potentially serve as validation for the infomap community detection algorithm. Some of this is fairly intuitive and to be expected: gene products that interact with each other tend to be part of the same biological processes and located in the same locations. Thus, it could be expected that each community will have significantly enriched GO terms, and many members of each community will share some of these significantly enriched GO terms.\n",
